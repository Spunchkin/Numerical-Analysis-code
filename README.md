<h1 align="center">Numerically Analysing my Data</h1>

<p align="center">
  <strong>Mission Statement</strong><br>
  "My mission is to implement various mathmatical algorithms in Python for practice, to test my skills, to doccument the methods, and just for fun"
</p>

<p align="center">
  <strong>Project Summary</strong><br>
  During my third year of post secondary, I learnt a ton of algorithms for solving problems in my numerical analysis course, however I have only implemented them in Python thusfar. Hence: my goal here is to implement algorithms, including but not limited to Newtons Method, the Bisection Method, Lagrange Interpolation, Trapezoid & Simpsons Integration, & Lipshitz Algorithm, as well as Eulers & Heuns Methods for aproximating ODE's. Also Just for fun im going to sprinkle in some of my own creations i've wanted for a while - such as using multiple regression techniques to find the best fit function on a dataset.
